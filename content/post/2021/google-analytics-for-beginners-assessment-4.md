## Note
There are five different campaign tags that help you identify specific information about your campaign traffic. Medium, Source, and Campaign are required campaign tags. You can also add tags for Content and Term.

- **"Medium"** communicates the mechanism, or how you sent your message to the user. You could include “email” for an email campaign, “cpc” for paid search ads, or “social” for a social network.
- **“Source”** communicates where the user came from. This could be a specific web page or a link in an email. Source could also differentiate the type of medium. So if the medium was “cpc” (or “cost per click” paid traffic), the source might be “google,” “bing,” or “yahoo.” If the medium was “email,” the source might be “newsletter”.
- **“Campaign”** can communicate the name of your marketing campaign such as “2015-Back-To-School” or “2015-Holiday-Sale”.
- **“Content”** can be used to differentiate versions of a promotion. This is useful when you want to test which version of an ad or promotion is more effective. If you’re running a test between two different versions of a newsletter, you might want to label these tags “v1-10dollars-off” and “v2-nopromo” to help differentiate which newsletter the data is associated with in Google Analytics.
- **“Term”** is used to identify the keyword for paid search campaigns. You would only use this field if you are manually tagging a paid search campaign like Bing or Yahoo!. We’ll talk about the best way to track Google Ads in a later lesson.

Distinction between two types of goals: business goads and Google Analytic Goals.

- **Business goals** are actions you want your user to take on your website. Each time a user completes one of your business goals, we call this a “conversion.” This could be signing up for a newsletter or buying a product.
